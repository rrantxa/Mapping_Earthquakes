# Mapping Earthquakes: a Leaflet Project
## *Purpose of the Project*
The purpose of this project was to map data concerning the earthquakes that have ocurred around the world for the past week. Our final map included three different map styles, as well as the option to toggle on and off the following data:
 1. General earthquake data for the past 7 days.
 2. A visual representation of the world's tectonic plates.
 3. Earthquake data for the major earthquakes that ocurred during the past week. 

Finally, this project was done using the following tools:
1. HTML
2. Javascript
3. The Leaflet library.
4. The D3.js library.

You can find the final code in the "Earthquake_Challenge" folder.
